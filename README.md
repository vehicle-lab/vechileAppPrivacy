# Unveiling Potential Risks of In-Vehicle Apps.

We present the "in-vehicle App", "iArb detection", and "iArb analysis" for review and verification. Furthermore, we commit to open-sourcing all our work upon acceptance of the paper.

## In-vehicle App

Here we present the third-party in-vehicle App as the representative, including:

* Package name

* SHA256

## iArb Detection

Here we present the whole list of the permissions, APIs, and API parameters for each iArb, serving as the basis of detection at each layer. 

## iArb Analysis

Here we present the distribution of each iArb under various App categories of the three mainstream sources respectively, including: 

* Mobile Apps

* Third-party in-vehicle Apps

* Manufacture-customized in-vehicle Apps

The evaluation of the iArb from various perspectives derives from this.
